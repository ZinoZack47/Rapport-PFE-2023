\uppercase{To} my mother, who showered me with her support and devoted me with unconditional love. You are for me an example of courage and continuous sacrifice. May this humble work bear witness to my affection, my eternal attachment and may it call upon me your continual blessing,\\[12pt]
\uppercase{To} my father, no dedication can express the love, esteem, devotion, and respect I have always had for you. Nothing in the world is worth the efforts made day and night for my education and my well-being. This work is the fruit of your sacrifices that you made for my education and training,\\[12pt]
\uppercase{To} my dear brothers, thank you for your love, support, and encouragement,\\[12pt]
\uppercase{To} all my dear friends, for the support you have given me, I say\\[12pt]
Thank you.
