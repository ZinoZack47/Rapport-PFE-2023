\section{About}
Izicap is pioneering the use of payment card data and turning it into powerful customer knowledge & business
insights for merchants, allowing them to run their own loyalty programs and digital marketing campaigns. These
marketing services, provided by acquirers using Izicap’s SaaS solutions, quickly restore growth to merchant
businesses by building their customers (the card-holders) spending and stickiness. Izicap’s innovative card-linked
CRM & Loyalty solution gives acquirers a competitive edge by monetising their payment transactions data,
generating new sources of income and improving their retention capabilities. After having solidly established itself in
France thanks to partnerships with Groupe BPCE and Crédit Agricole, Izicap partnered with Nexi, the leading
acquirer & Fintech in Italy and has joined Mastercard’s StartPath program with an aim to dramatically expand its
worldwide reach. Izicap partners with leading payment solution providers such as Ingenico, Verifone, Poynt and PAX,
and makes its card-linked CRM & Loyalty solution available on the most popular and innovative payments terminals
