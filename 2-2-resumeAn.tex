This report provides an in-depth analysis of the complex project undertaken to scale the data source of Izicap. The project required the removal of MariaDB and implementation of Delta Lake, a high-performance data storage and processing solution. In addition, the existing monolithic architecture was divided into microservices utilizing Spring Boot as the backend with a suitable connector to Delta Lake, and ReactJS micro-frontends as the frontend.

\medskip

The project presented numerous challenges that required the application of advanced technologies and strategies. These included data migration, ensuring data consistency and accuracy, managing the complexities of distributed systems, and integrating various technologies and services. The report outlines the various solutions developed to address these challenges, including the use of advanced data processing algorithms, distributed computing architectures, and containerization.

\medskip

Despite the challenges encountered, the project remains a work in progress. The report provides insights into the ongoing efforts to improve the project's scalability, performance, and overall functionality.
